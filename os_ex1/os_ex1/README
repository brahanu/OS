Assignment 1 - Using strace to understand what a progam is doing:

If you run the command without execute permission you get :
    strace: exec: Permission denied\n", 32strace: exec: Permission denied
And the program exits
After granting the program execute permission you get:

If you running the program any number of arguments that different from one you get:
    "Error. The program should receive a single argument. Exiting.\n: Success\n"
Meaning the program writing an error message and then exits

If you run the program with exec one argument you get:
    mkdir("Welcome", 0775)                  = 0
    mkdir("Welcome/To", 0775)               = 0
    openat(AT_FDCWD, "Welcome/To/OS2020", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
    write(3, "brahan\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\nempty", 79) = 79
    close(3)                                = 0
    unlink("Welcome/To/OS2020")             = 0
    rmdir("Welcome/To/")                    = 0
    rmdir("Welcome/")                       = 0
    exit_group(0)

Meaning the program creates a directory named “Welcome” with mkdir
Inside of it it creates another directory named To
Then its create a file called OS2020 (if its already created then it's just open it)
Inside the new file it writes:
 "USER_NAME\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\nGIVEN_INPUTFILE"
Then we delete the OS2020 file with unlink and the directory with rmdir and exit the program.
